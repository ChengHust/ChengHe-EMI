  abstract = {Many real-world optimization applications have more than one objective, which are modeled as multiobjective optimization problems. Generally, those complex objective functions are approximated by expensive simulations rather than cheap analytic functions, which have been formulated as data-driven multiobjective optimization problems. The high computational costs of those problems pose great challenges to existing evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms. Unfortunately, there have not been any benchmark problems reflecting those challenges yet. Therefore, we carefully select seven benchmark multiobjective optimization problems from real-world applications, aiming to promote the research on data-driven evolutionary multiobjective optimization by suggesting a set of benchmark problems extracted from various real-world optimization applications.},
